## Introduction

### Learn everything

Everyone can create their own backend. See [here](https://linwood.tk/docs/dev-doctor/own-backend) and everyone can add it to the server list in the settings.

### Learn everywhere

You don't need to login. Everything is saved on the local device. In the future we add offline support.
